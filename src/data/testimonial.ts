    descriptions: `I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing Matheus’ professional journey since 
      his early days in the tech field, and I’ve always been impressed by how quickly and 
      deeply he learns.
      He approaches challenges with an open and collaborative mindset. Even when he’s not 
      the most senior person on the team, he consistently steps up to support both projects 
      and teammates.
      Matheus is someone who’s always seeking to grow — whether by learning from his colleagues, 
      reflecting on his own work, or understanding the broader impact of the products he helps 
      build. On top of that, he maintains excellent interpersonal relationships and contributes 
      to a positive team dynamic.
      In a market where effective results through technology are increasingly sought, Matheus is 
      the kind of professional you can rely on. Whenever I have the opportunity, I invite him to 
      join my projects.

    descriptions: `Working with Matheus was an enriching experience.
      Since his very first professional role, his eagerness to learn 
      and overcome challenges has always stood out. I had the privilege 
      of closely following his growth, as we were part of the same team, 
      and I can confidently say: he is relentless. He always gives his best, 
      collaborates excellently, is ready to help, and is constantly seeking new knowledge.

      A great example of this was our many conversations about design—not just product
      design, but design as a discipline. Matheus was one of the key advocates for design 
      quality in our context, always going above and beyond to contribute. His growth is 
      inevitable, and any team would be lucky to have him. A highly recommended professional!

      He has an energy that inspires and drives those around him. Working with him was always 
      a smooth and motivating experience.
